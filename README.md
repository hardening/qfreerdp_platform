# FreeRDP Qt platform plugin

## Application details

This is a Qt5 platform plugin to export application through RDP without modifying
the original code.

## Requirements

* Qt5 development librairies (>= 5.12.8)
* libfreerdp (>= 2.100.20230321)

## Set up dev environment

```shell
export INSTALL_PATH=/your/preferred/install/path
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${INSTALL_PATH}/usr/lib/pkgconfig:${INSTALL_PATH}/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${INSTALL_PATH}/usr/lib/
```

## Install requirements (for Ubuntu 22.04)

### system libraries

```shell
apt install qtbase5-private-dev libxkbcommon-dev libglib2.0-dev libxrender-dev libudev-dev libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev libxcursor-dev qttools5-dev-tools
```

## Installation

### Configuration

Have a look inside `meson_options.txt` to see what options you might want to
change while configuring the project, and then:

```shell
meson setup build -Dprefix=${INSTALL_PATH}/usr -Dglobal_install=false
```

### Compilation

```shell
ninja -C build install
```

## Using

To use the platform plugin you need to specify the path where QT can find plugins:

```shell
export QT_PLUGIN_PATH=${INSTALL_PATH}/usr/lib/
```

Now launch any Qt5 program (you'll find many in the examples directory of Qt) with the
`-platform freerdp` parameter, for example:

```shell
./menus -platform freerdp
```

You can also provide options to the freerdp platform:

```shell
./menus -platform freerdp:port=3389:address=127.0.0.1
```

| `qtwebengineKbdCompat` | `qtwebengineKbdCompat` | Client layout dependent Qt key events | Flag to force qfreerdp to always emit Qt key events as if generated by a Qwerty (us) layout so that qtWebEngine can generate correct key.code events. |

## Qt WebEngine

If you want to use qfreerdp in front of a Qt WebEngine application, keep in
mind that its keyboard support is subpar, especially for layouts different than
US qwerty. In particular, `KeyEvent.code` for javascript will be deduced with
the assumption that QKeyEvents were sent using a US qwerty layout[0] if you are
not using one of the few mainstream platforms (xcb, wayland, windows, cocoa).

In order to try to somewhat improve the state of things for qfreerdp, we make available two workarounds:

* First, qfreerdp has the option masquerade as `xcb`, as in that case Qt WebEngine actually handles QKeyEvents' nativeScanCode and nativeModifiers correctly. Simply use `-platform freerdp_xcb` instead of the usual `freerdp`
* The `qtwebengineKbdCompat` platform option, that will convert all Qt::Key events sent as if they were generated by a qwerty layout, so that the reverse operation done by Qt WebEngine is actually correct. However this approach has a few caveats:
    * AltGr isn't supported until Qt6.7
    * The `IntlBackslash` key, present on ISO layouts but not ANSI layouts, isn't supported.

Those two workarounds suffer from the same additional limitations:

* No support for NumLock until https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-134107 is fixed
* Dead keys take one more keypress to take effect.
